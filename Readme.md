# Farkle
This repository contains the code to the famous game Farkle! This project is also an android studio project 
and can be played on an andriod app. The game shows the amount of points colleced by the player and how many
rounds the player has played. 

## Rules to farkle 
Images of dice 1-6 will pop up on the app and the user must "roll" the dice. Once this is done the user will 
have a chanve to score the dice or end the round. The user will be able to score the specific dice as per allowed
(shown below). Once the user scores they have a chance to either role the remaining unscored dice or stop the round. 
Whenever the round is stopped the total points accumalated that round gets added to the user's total overall points.
If at any point the user rolls the dice and none of the dices are scorable, then the total points accumalated that 
round gets set to 0
